# Stone_Paper_Scissor-Game
This game is made using Java only , and it run on the terminal window of your IDE.

As part of a hands-on project, I developed a Rock-Paper-Scissors game to apply my programming and problem-solving skills. The goal was to build a simple yet interactive game that could be played between a user and the computer. I chose this project to demonstrate logic building, user interaction, and control flow concepts in programming.

I began by analyzing the rules of the game: rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock. I implemented the game using a high-level programming language (e.g., Java) due to its simplicity and readability. First, I used conditional statements (if-elif-else) to compare the player's choice with the computer's randomly generated choice, utilizing the random module for the computer’s move.

Next, I focused on user input validation, ensuring the game handles invalid entries gracefully. I used loops to allow multiple rounds of play, giving the user an option to continue or quit. The program kept track of scores to display the winner at the end, applying basic variables and counters.

I also applied modular programming by defining functions for tasks such as getting user input, generating the computer’s move, determining the winner, and displaying the results. This improved code readability and reusability.

This project helped me reinforce my knowledge of basic programming constructs, logic design, and user interaction. It also improved my debugging and code organization skills. Overall, building the Rock-Paper-Scissors game was an effective way to apply theoretical knowledge to a practical and enjoyable task.
